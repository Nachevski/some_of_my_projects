Description:  
- Brainster Labs - Aplication where it shows projects with different categories so you can filter them. Initially they are hardcoded, but easely can be transformed with real data.  
For this projects I choose to use SASS, Vanila JS, PHP, and MySql for database.  
  
- Brainster Library - Aplpication for showing books with different categories. It is accesible for every user, so unregistered user can view the books but only registered users 
can write comments and personal notes for books. Every comment he leaves, it must first be approved by the admin before it shows on page. Admins has full control over the app. They can
create new book, modify and delete them, they also can create/edit/delete new authors, categories, and also they must first modify and approve/reject all comments that are left from users
 before they appear on the page.  
For building this app I used:  
My very own CSS for styling  
JQuery  
SweetAlert Library  
PHP ver. 8  
MySQL  
  
- Memory game - Classic memory game where you can choose between 2 cards and find the same ones. I made this project initialy for my niece, also launched on local server, so she can play on
